# TextUtils
This is a repository that I created on this day of 5th May
This is a website in which we can utilize our text by removing punctuations converting upper case text removing newlines and extraspaces from any text.

Steps to run the code:
1) Open the pycharm and go to the path where templates  where code is stored.
2) Run the code.
3) Give any text and give punctuations , newlines, extraspaces, lowercase letters.
4) Then select chechboxes one by one or simultaneously, it will correct all the text in a very proper way.
